# Survival_analysis

The purpose of those 2 notebooks are to analyze subscription survival data. The aim of the analysis is to forecast the monthly retention rate and survival function and to derive business recommendations with regards to different dimensions available (country, price of the subscription and source of acquisition). 
Some additional analysis has been conducted on the revenue per subscription price and on the lifetime value of each subscriber at the moment of the acquisition.

Main techniques used are sBG (shifted Beta geometric distribution), Weibull and one-layer MLP.

Subscriptions_1 is a python notebook while Survival and maps is a R notebook
